# üß† Employee Attrition Prediction System
<p align="justify">
This project implements a machine learning-based predictive system to forecast employee attrition. It uses the <strong>XGBoost classifier</strong>, trained on historical HR data, to help organizations proactively retain top talent. It also includes a <strong>Gradio web application</strong> to simulate predictions based on user inputs.
</p>

# üìä Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
Traditional HR approaches like exit interviews are reactive and provide little time to prevent turnover. This project aims to <strong>predict attrition early</strong> by analyzing patterns in employee data.

# üîç Key Features
- **4 ML Models Compared**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost (see: 3-SRC/ML Models Testing.py)
- **Best Accuracy**: XGBoost (92%).
- **Live Predictions**: Built with Gradio to visualize likely outcomes.
- **Insightful Charts**: Understand which roles, departments, and conditions contribute to attrition.

# üí° Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
- Gradio (for Web App).
- Joblib (for model saving).
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization).

# üìä Results and Insights
- XGBoost achieved 92% accuracy.
- Employees with low income, poor work-life balance, and low job satisfaction were more likely to leave.
- Highest attrition observed in Sales and R&D.
- Roles most at risk are Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians.

# üîÆ Future Enhancements
- Implement Explainable AI (XAI) methods.
- Add bias/fairness analysis for sensitive features.
- Expand dataset across multiple organizations.
